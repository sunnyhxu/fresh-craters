# Fresh Craters on the MoonðŸŒ•
This is a project aiming to estimate lunar regolith thickness with the size and morphology of (non)rocky-ejecta craters. We want to test the hypothesis that older lunar surfaces have thicker regolith due to a longer exposure to cratering.

## Apollo landing sites
I looked for fresh craters around past Apollo missions landing sites and compared our method's estimation of regolith thickness with on-site measurement to verify the accuracy of our method. 
- Used [Lunar/LROC :: QuickMap](https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu/) to map craters and extract key features. 
- Documented crater data and analysis in [this table](/fresh%20craters-apollo.xlsx).
- Stored crater positions in .geojson form in craters folder. The .geojson files can be uploaded to [Lunar/LROC :: QuickMap](https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu/) for graphical display.
